# pi-gate: A Lightweight DNS Sinkhole

**pi-gate** is a lightweight DNS sinkhole designed to block unwanted URLs, such as advertisements, malware sites, and trackers. It operates as a DNS server, filtering traffic at the network level to enhance privacy and security. Built for efficiency, it is optimized for low-resource devices like the Raspberry Pi Zero.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Current Features
- **DNS Sinkhole Functionality**: Blocks unwanted domains by intercepting DNS queries.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Designed to run efficiently on minimal hardware.
- **Logging System**: Logs DNS queries to track blocked and allowed domains.
- **Configurable Blocklists**: Supports loading custom blocklists for domain filtering.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: `pi-gate start` and `pi-gate stop` commands for easy control.
- **Background Execution**: Runs as a background service using Poetry.

### üöÄ Upcoming Features
- **Optimized AsyncIO Handling**: Improve efficiency in DNS request processing.
- **Dashboard Enhancements**:
  - View DNS logs in real-time.
  - Whitelist management: Allow specific domains.
  - IP Management: Block/allow specific IPs if required.
- **Multiprocessing Support**: Enhance performance for handling multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Better Deployment Support**: Simplified installation and setup.

## How It Works

A DNS sinkhole intercepts DNS queries and returns a null response (or a specific IP) for blocked domains. Instead of reaching the actual malicious or ad-serving server, the request is stopped at the DNS level, preventing unwanted content from loading.

### üìå DNS Sinkhole Workflow
1. Device requests a domain (e.g., `example.com`).
2. `pi-gate` checks its blocklist.
   - If blocked, returns a null IP (`0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1`).
   - If allowed, forwards the request to the upstream DNS (e.g., Google DNS, Cloudflare).
3. The response is logged and returned to the client.
4. Blocked domains do not load, improving security and privacy.
